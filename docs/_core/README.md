# DataQuest – Core Documentation

This folder contains the **only documents required for active development, technical evaluation, and capstone review**.

If you are unsure where to start, start here.

**Intended audience:**

- Capstone reviewers and faculty evaluators
- Active developers and maintainers
- New contributors onboarding to the project

## Recommended Reading Order

1. **SSOT.md**The single source of truth for the entire project.
2. **SSOT-Index.md**The authoritative map of where all official specifications and design documents live.
3. **Architecture-Overview.md**How the system is structured, how components interact, and why key design decisions were made.
4. **AI-Agent-Workflow.md**How the AI agents collaborate during the Plan → Verify → Tutor learning cycle.
5. **Development-Roadmap.md**
   What gets built, when it gets built, and the rationale behind the sequencing.

## Scope and Intent

All other documentation in the repository exists to:

- justify design decisions
- provide audit trails and compliance evidence
- capture exploratory analysis and alternatives
- preserve historical and process context

Those documents are **intentionally excluded** from this folder.

This `_core` directory represents the **minimal, authoritative working set** needed to understand, evaluate, and extend DataQuest without noise.
